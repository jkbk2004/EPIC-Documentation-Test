Singularity and Docker Containers
=================================

Containers allow users to package up softwares in a way that is portable and reproducible. Users can build Singularity and Docker containers on laptop computers and then deploy on different types of the shared HPC cluster systems for the use in large communities such as universities or research insttitues. As the containers are provided in a single file, it drastically reduces the software maintenance issues that users need to address on different operating systems.
